<ul>
<li> The average temperature varies only four degrees in Hawaii, from 71° in December to 75° in December.</li>
<li> The coldest it gets is 56°, in December. The coldest temperature in June is 64°.</li>
<li> The hottest it gets is 85° in June, and 83° in December, only a 2° variation.</li>
<li> Although there are fewer data points in December (1517) in comparison to June's 1700, there is still plenty of data to get a sense of climate in Hawaii.   
  

## Summary
  
Hawaii has a moderate climate where the temperature in winter varries little from the summer heat, in fact only 4°. Based on this data, it would be a great place to open a surf shop where seasonality shouldn't have a large impact on consumers. 

It would be great to see the June and Dec comparison over time. A stacked bar with a year to year comparison would let us know if there is an annual temperature change trend. 

It would also be great to see precipitation for these months... over time. Although warm, it may be the rainy season and deter surfers although most surfers I know don't care about rain fall if the surf is up.
